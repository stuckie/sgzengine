SGZEngine - A prototyping engine mostly used throughout Ludum Dare 15 to 17

This was originally my Honours project, and then got various tweaks throughout Ludum Dare 15 (Moons of Subterrane) and 17 (Yargh!)
It will still compile under Linux ( including 64bit ) and may compile on the other platforms too.
It also has a CodeLite project and workspace.

The basic idea of this was to offload everything to Lua, and have it tick the engine over.
Lua could override any part of the engine, making it more a large VM than anything else.
And this was before things like LOVE really took off!
